# Double Carousel
This is an interesting example of an Agnitio presentation that I made once. Its purpose is to show a vertical carousel whose slides have a different appearance depending on whether they are selected or not. If you look at the image you will have the impression there is just one carousel when in fact there are two of them. See the image:
