# Cross Tab Context Library
> A Web Storage easy utility that can work on any kind of application. Made one Typescript :)

<br>

## Prerequisites
Have Node JS version >= 5.0 and NPM >= 3 installed. It is recommended to use Node LTS version 6.9.1 though.

## Up and running
Clone the repo or download the zip and in your project folder run these commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
Then you get your library file on `./lib/cross-tab-context.js`

The outcome is plain JS generated by Webpack.
The whole library is assigned to a global variable so it can work on any kind of application. No need to use Javascript modules.

## Usage
Import the library into your project and call the methods from `./src/cross-tab-context.ts`
* getFromStorageArea(anyFeature, storageArea) gets data (object from a certain feature (or app) on the chosen Storage area.
* setInStorageArea(obj, anyFeature, storageArea) sets data (object) for a certain feature (or app) from the chosen Storage area.
* removeFromStorageArea(anyFeature, storageArea) removes data (object) from a certain feature (or app) on the chosen Storage area.
* listen(key, callback) listens to the 'storage' event and and execute the callback only for changes on the given key.
