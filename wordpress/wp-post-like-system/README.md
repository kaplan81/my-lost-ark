# Wordpress: post like system. 
It is actually possible in WP to create a like link very similar to the one in a social network like Facebook. You only need to pass metadata to the post through an AJAX request. This way we can rate a post by counting its number of likes. We just make sure a single user is not capable of liking the same post twice. Pretty neat.
